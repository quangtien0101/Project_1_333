# Project_1_333
Create a linux kernel

# Get the system ready
Install the Linux headers library
	***$ apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)***

# Build
I've already include the ***insmod*** and the ***rmmod*** commands in the make file so once you run the ***make*** command you can run ***make run*** to execute these 2 commands
***$ sudo make***
***$ sudo make run*** 

# Run the user's application
***$ sudo ./user***
